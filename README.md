## 3. Main Functionalities of the Wallet

### QR Scan Functionality
- **General Use**:
    - The QR Scan function is used to scan QR codes, which can trigger processes for obtaining or presenting credentials. This feature simplifies the interaction with various credential-related services.

### Credential Issuance Process
- **PIN Verification**:
    - If the credential issuance process includes PIN verification (used for additional security), you will be prompted to enter a PIN that you have received through a communication channel specified by the issuer.

      ![Enter PIN](./assets/wallet-6.png "Entering PIN during Credential Issuance")

- **Manual Intervention for Credential Signing**:
    - For credentials that require manual signing, such as DOME issued credentials, you will initially receive them in an 'unsigned' state. You'll see an 'unsigned' notification and a 'Sign' button within your wallet. Once you are notified that your signed credential is ready, use the 'Sign' button in the wallet to finalize the credential.

### Credential Presentation Process
- **Automatic Credential Display for Specific Types**:
    - When required to present a credential, the wallet automatically displays all available credentials of the type required for the transaction or verification. Select the appropriate credential you wish to present and confirm the action. If the presentation is successful, a confirmation pop-up will appear, indicating a successful transaction or verification.

### Credential Deletion
- **Deleting a Credential**:
    - If you choose to delete a credential, simply press the trash icon on the credential. Be aware that once a credential is deleted, it cannot be recovered, so you must obtain a new one through the issuance process if needed.
